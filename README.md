# Company directory

This is a simple website that allows users to search the Icelandic company directory. API calls go through an PHP proxy server that filters the results. Users are able to favorite companies from the search results and those are saved to local storage.

## To run this project

It is recommended to run the proxy server with the "PHP server" VScode extension.

`npm install` and then `npm run start` to view in development mode or `npm run build` to build the app for production to the build folder.
